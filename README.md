# Vision Guide - Multi-Object Detection System

## Overview
Vision Guide is a mobile application designed to assist visually impaired individuals by providing real-time object detection and audio descriptions of their surroundings. Using a smartphone's camera, the application detects, classifies, and tracks multiple objects, integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and audio feedback to enhance user experience and independence.

## Features
- **Real-time Object Detection & Tracking**: Utilizes deep learning models to identify and track multiple objects in the cameraâ€™s field of view.
- **Audio Descriptions**: Converts detected objects into meaningful voice feedback for visually impaired users.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive UI designed for easy accessibility.
- **Smartphone Integration**: Leverages mobile device cameras to eliminate the need for expensive hardware.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enhances object descriptions to provide better contextual awareness.

## Technology Stack
- **Machine Learning**: YOLO (You Only Look Once) / SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Mobile Development**: React Native
- **Backend**: Firebase / Node.js / python

## How It Works
1. The user points their smartphone camera towards an object.
2. The application processes the camera feed in real-time.
3. Detected objects are classified and described using a trained deep learning model.
4. An audio description of the object is generated and played for the user.

## Use Cases
- **Navigation Assistance**: Helps visually impaired individuals understand their surroundings.
- **Object Recognition**: Identifies objects in a room, on a street, or in stores.

## Testing
- This application was tested in **ExpoGo** for real-time performance and functionality assessment.
